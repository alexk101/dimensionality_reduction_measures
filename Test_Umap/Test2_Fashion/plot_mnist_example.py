"""
UMAP on the MNIST Digits dataset
--------------------------------

A simple example demonstrating how to use UMAP on a larger
dataset such as MNIST. We first pull the MNIST dataset and
then use UMAP to reduce it to only 2-dimensions for
easy visualisation.

Note that UMAP manages to both group the individual digit
classes, but also to retain the overall global structure
among the different digit classes -- keeping 1 far from
0, and grouping triplets of 3,5,8 and 4,7,9 which can
blend into one another in some cases.
